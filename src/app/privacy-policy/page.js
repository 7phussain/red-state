            This privacy policy explains how we collect information from you and the purposes for which it is used.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-5">Information you provide</h2>
          <p>
            You may provide us with personal contact information in several ways,
            including but not limited to sending a property enquiry, corresponding
            with us via email, completing a survey, entering a competition,
            completing a review, providing feedback, or reporting an issue. We
            only store your personal data after you have consented by agreeing to
            our terms and conditions on the relevant form.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-5">Information we collect</h2>
          <p>
            We automatically collect metadata from your web browser, which may
            include the type and version, device make and model, IP address,
            referral domain, and browser language setting.
          </p>

            Ways in which we may share your personal information
          </h2>
          <p>
            We may provide your name, email, and phone number to agents when you
            send a property enquiry through REDESTATE. Once this data is shared,
            the agentâ€™s own privacy policy will apply. We may also send
            information about your visit to analytics and search engine providers
            to improve our services. This data may include your IP address, pages
            visited, and browser type but does not contain any direct personal
            identifiers such as your name or email address. Additionally, we may
            share your metadata with advertising networks to serve relevant ads.
            If REDESTATE or its assets are acquired, the user data we hold will be
            part of the transfer. If we obtain professional advice (e.g., from
            lawyers or financial advisors), we may disclose your personal
            information. We may also disclose your personal information if
            required by a government or regulatory authority.
          </p>
