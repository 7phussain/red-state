        <p className="text-center">
          This privacy policy explains how we collect information from you and
          the purposes for which it is used.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Information you provide</h2>
        <p>
          You may provide us with personal contact information in several ways,
          including but not limited to sending a property enquiry, corresponding
          with us via email, completing a survey, entering a competition,
          completing a review, providing feedback, or reporting an issue. We
          only store your personal data after you have consented by agreeing to
          our terms and conditions on the relevant form.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">Information we collect</h2>
        <p>
          We automatically collect metadata from your web browser, which may
          include the type and version, device make and model, IP address,
          referral domain, and browser language setting.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-4">
          Ways in which we may share your personal information
        </h2>
        <p>
          We may provide your name, email, and phone number to agents when you
          send a property enquiry through REDESTATE. Once this data is shared,
          the agentâ€™s own privacy policy will apply. We may also send
          information about your visit to analytics and search engine providers
          to improve our services. This data may include your IP address, pages
          visited, and browser type but does not contain any direct personal
          identifiers such as your name or email address. Additionally, we may
          share your metadata with advertising networks to serve relevant ads.
          If REDESTATE or its assets are acquired, the user data we hold will be
          part of the transfer. If we obtain professional advice (e.g., from
          lawyers or financial advisors), we may disclose your personal
          information. We may also disclose your personal information if
          required by a government or regulatory authority.
        </p>
